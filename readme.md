## by Chris Silvia


## Dataset

The dataset is provided by Prosper Loans, and includes information on 113,937
loans up through 2014, with 81 separate variables on each loan included.


## Summary of Findings

The vast majority of the loans are debt consolidation. The second most common
category listed is "Not Available", but that category of loans has very
different characteristics from the known loan types. The loan types also differ
in their average amounts, APRs, the existing debt of the borrowers, and several
other variables.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Loans for categories that people need, such as for business, home, student use,
are drastically more frequent, which higher proportions of people who struggle
economically, as indicated by their debt ratios and the proportion of loans
that are charged off.
